VCVD2022 - Simulating Breaking Distance Project

Steps to follow in order to use the system:
- Step 1: Introduce the mass of the vehicle
- Step 2: Introduce the velocity of the vehicle
- Step 3: Select road type
- Step 4: select the respectedd road condition to the desired road type
- Step 5: See the calculated breaking distance
- Step 6: See the resulting 2 plots of distance vs time & velocity vs time
